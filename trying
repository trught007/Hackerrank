	Primitive
		Integer(4 bytes)
		Float()
		Character

Range of Integer 
(2^32)-1

To tell negative integer

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ......... like that, so the first space shows the sign of the number{(0 +ve), (1 -ve)}

like that so 1 is occupied, so total numbers are (2^31)-1

$Float
we can save upto 7 decimal places. (size 4 bits)
$Double
we can save upto 15 decimal places.(size 8 bits)
$Char
simple ascii table
$Long int
type of data type to increase size of int from 4 to 8
$Short Int
type of data type to reduce size ofint form 4 to 2

TIP:- When changing or using various data types always build the program again, then compile, then execute.... it might give some errors otherwise
